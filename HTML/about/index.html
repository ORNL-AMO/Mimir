	  <div id="about-paragraph">
			<p><strong>What is Mimir?</strong></p>
			<p>Mimir is an open source dashboard that will read in live data from energy equipment, do efficiency calculations, and show efficiency
				levels in three different readings: one showing the current reading, another showing a more efficient curve given the current equipment,
				and the last one showing the optimal curve for the most energy efficiency. The AMO-Tools Suite created by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory
				(ORNL) is used to calculate the efficiencies. The AMO-Tools Suite, also called MEASUR, is a project for the Department of Energy. </p>
			<p><strong>Who created it?</strong></p>
			<p>Mimir was created by Quentin Johnson, Mariah Mensah, Austin Stephens, Christopher Nagy, Miranda Cheatham, and Michael Colby, six computer
				 science students from Tennessee Technological University. </p>
	    <p><strong>Who is it for?</strong></p>
	    <p>Mimir is intended for any manufacturing professional who wants to check the efficiency of their pumps and potentially save money and energy. </p>
